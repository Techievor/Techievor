Techievor was started with designers and developers in mind to help flourish discussion over the best standards and practices. We love to share articles, tutorials, examples, and ideas on innovative app design practices, development techniques, and technology. The positive feedback from our readers helps us to find out as a community just how the best way is to tackle a situation based on the tools available for the job.

Techievor is built upon MEANcore-CMS, a blogging platform designed with the MEAN Stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, Angular, NodeJS). MEANcore-CMS has been designed to be easily extensible and customisable throughout the code base. Feel like it's missing something? Let us know! Like what you see? Support us on Patreon!

Techievor was created and launched by David Oravsky in February 2019.
